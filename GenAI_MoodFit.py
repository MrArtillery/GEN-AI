#
#  Ever stare at your closet and think, "I have nothing to wear"?
#  MoodFit is a fun project that tries to solve that problem by suggesting what to wear
#  based on two things that really influence our choices: your current mood and the
#  local weather.
#
#  How it works:
#  1.  It activates your webcam to see your facial expression and guess your emotion.
#  2.  It finds your location to get the current weather conditions.
#  3.  A simple "Rule Engine" combines your mood and the weather to recommend
#      clothing categories from the popular Fashion-MNIST dataset.
